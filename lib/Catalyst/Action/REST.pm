=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Action::REST - Automated REST Method Dispatching

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    sub foo :Local :ActionClass('REST') {
      ... do setup for HTTP method specific handlers ...
    }

    sub foo_GET { 
      ... do something for GET requests ...
    }

    sub foo_PUT { 
      ... do somethign for PUT requests ...
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Action handles doing automatic method dispatching for REST requests.  It
takes a normal Catalyst action, and changes the dispatch to append an
underscore and method name. 

For example, in the synopsis above, calling GET on "/foo" would result in
the foo_GET method being dispatched.

If a method is requested that is not implemented, this action will 
return a status 405 (Method Not Found).  It will populate the "Allow" header 
with the list of implemented request methods.  You can override this behavior
by implementing a custom 405 handler like so:

   sub foo_not_implemented {
      ... handle not implemented methods ...
   }

If you do not provide an _OPTIONS subroutine, we will automatically respond
with a 200 OK.  The "Allow" header will be populated with the list of
implemented request methods.

It is likely that you really want to look at L<Catalyst::Controller::REST>,
which brings this class together with automatic Serialization of requests
and responses.

When you use this module, the request class will be changed to
L<Catalyst::Request::REST>.

=item dispatch

This method overrides the default dispatch mechanism to the re-dispatching
mechanism described above.

You likely want to look at L<Catalyst::Controller::REST>, which implements
a sensible set of defaults for a controller doing REST.

=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

=over 4

=item Q: I'm getting a "415 Unsupported Media Type" error. What gives?!

A:  Most likely, you haven't set Content-type equal to "application/json", or one of the 
accepted return formats.  You can do this by setting it in your query string thusly:
?content-type=application%2Fjson (where %2F == / uri escaped). 

**NOTE** Apache will refuse %2F unless configured otherise.
Make sure AllowEncodedSlashes On is in your httpd.conf file in order for this to run smoothly.
